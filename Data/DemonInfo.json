    "Name": "Alice",
    "Description": "Dark oriented unit with Mamudoon, Mudodyne and her unique Die for Me! (DfM) (Kills a single enemy, one use only). Yup, she can kill anyone she points her finger at and so she's really good for shutting down dangerous opponents and can hit hard provided they don't have dark immunity as that's all her base kit relies on.",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Resist Light (If not Teal). she should have her weakness covered. Dark Boost. Increase her dark damage further, if you run it with Purple, then she's stuck with dark skills only (provided you covered weakness) Megido (If not Clear/Yellow). As she only uses Dark skills, Almighty can be used when you face dark immune/resistant opponents. Any other element would work too, but almighty would be best.",
    "Brands": "Divine/Ward helps you charge up for DfM as quickly as possible, though Spell would work as Mamudoon and Mudodyne both cost 6 mp only.",
    "Common": "Soul Drain gives her a single target almighty skill, giving her more coverage. Since she's too reliant on dark this is good for when you face dark immune opponents.",
    "Red": "She doesn't really need more dark skills so Hell Gaze wouldn't help much in that department. Sure it's an upgrade to Mudodyne, but it leaves less flexibility in your final skill slots (Mudodyne works well enough anyways). Glacial Blast enables her to use ice. Being multi-hit it would be good for bosses but can be stopped by ndr and so it's better generally to get single target to ensure you can land a hit or aoe if you know no enemies are immune.",
    "Yellow": "Necro Dogma gives her an almighty skill to play with, also landing more of a support role (Necro Dogma has a Rakukaja effect) and giving her more coverage. It is quite a costly skill however, so if you want to make the most out of it, it's recommended running Divine brands with it. Epic Recovery is a rare skill, but currently is pretty bad. For defending yourself against ailments, its better to rely on preventing it rather than rng to cure it.",
    "Purple": "Dark Amp stacks up her dark damage, making it hit way harder Wild Instinct is pretty bad as well. Reducing crit damage taken is not that great (she also has quite high luck so won't be hit by crits that much in the first place)",
    "Teal": "Repel Light covers her light weakness, granting her immunity as well. She can pair well with Alilat to prevent Light and Dark pierce. Thunder Reign gives her a powerful single target elec skill, so it'll capitalize on her high magic stat and more coverage (which she really needs)."

  {
    "Name": "Mother Harlot",
    "Description": "Comes with 2 unique skills: Death Lust (increased dmg to charmed enemies, chance to charm foes at the start of your turn), Babylon Goblet (BG) (almighty aoe skill which drains 1mp from each target hit) and Mana Gain. She punishes teams without Ward brands and in pve content has a chance to charm enemies every wave. Babylon Goblet is amazing at draining mp out of the enemy team (using her in a Jack Bros setup you can rob them of all their mana, preventing them from counterattacking)",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Resist Force. She has a weakness that should be covered. Serial Killer/Butcher. Increases her BG damage since it's almighty based Endure. Gives her survivability.",
    "Brands": "Divine to spam Babylon Goblet. Some of the top players use Life to ensure she stays alive as long as possible. Spell if you want Babylon Goblet to do more damage, you'd always start off draining 4mp (effectively reducing its cost to 4 from 8, or 3 from 7 if you maxed it out), though the less opponents alive, the less effective it'll be in returning mana to her. Ward if you're worried of her being inflicted by ailments. Shield would be good otherwise.",
    "Common": "Magic Amp III Increases her base magic, this can be decent if you're into min maxing and don't really care about the other archetypes",
    "Red": "Deathtouch gives her a single target skill. Be wary though as if you don't use Divine brands, she'd use this over BG. Tetraka Shift helps when starting second, it prevents phys attacks though isn't as good as it used to be due to the prevalent use of pierce",
    "Yellow": "Debilitate allows her to lend support your party (Though you still should be spamming Babylon Goblet when you can) through the best debuff in the game. Since double debuffs exist, Debiliate doesn't shine as much as its essentially the same with an extra debuff tacked on. Infernal Mask is amazing for her due to her natural high luck, greatly increasing ailment infliction/resistance. It also means you don't have to run ward (I would not replace this skill because of its usefulness and rarity)",
    "Purple": "Stacking Deadly Charm with her passive, would amp up damage done to charmed enemies (Have another demon spam charm to get the best out of it). Insanity will increase her chances of charming enemies overall (this will affect her initial charm passive i'm pretty sure)",
    "Teal": "Drain Phys is most useful when you have Rama with you (since she has Drain Elec as well), stopping piercing phys hitters and Thor from from sweeping you. Naturally she has Null Phys anyways and so prevents phys aoe in general. Makara Shift is nice defensively for when you start second in pvp."

  {
    "Name": "Trumpeter",
    "Description": "Has no weaknesses and Nulls Light/Dark, he comes with Concentrate, Soul Drain and his unique skill Apocalypse (Almighty, hit all with chance to mute). Given his toolkit he can be used as an alternative on the Jack Bros sweeping team (easier to build compared to Ishtar, less expensive). People don't really run Memutudi as well so they'd waste press turns waiting for mute to go away. The best approach is running barrier break on a demon that acts before him to remove Ward.",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Insanity/Madness. Increasing his chance of inflicting mute. Endure/Enduring Soul. Gives him more chances do the Concentrate + Apocalypse combo. Serial Killer/Butcher. Increases his Apocalypse damage. Deadly Mute. Reliant on an opponent being muted in the first place, however adds a large damage boost compared to Serial Killer/Butcher.",
    "Brands": "Divine/Ward. Apocalypse is costly, so be sure to get divine so you can two turn use it. Maxing it out would help with mp cost but this brand setup would still be good for when you want to Concentrate then Apocalypse as soon as possible.",
    "Common": "Mahamakajamaon is bad on him. Since Apocalypse already comes with Mute, this skill is a waste.",
    "Red": "Judgement would boost your damage though it'd be better just using Tarukaja/having another demon cast it. Evade makes him dodge more attacks which can be good for facing phys units (he naturally has pretty good agi).",
    "Yellow": "Demon Birth Cry is situational and more defensive. Regardless the best approach is using Apocalypse, dealing damage and muting. Auto-Tarunda gives you a defensive head start, good for keeping him and your team alive. Pair this with Purple's Auto-Rakuka and you can easily survive counter attacks (when starting first)",
    "Purple": "Auto-Rakuka allows your party to start off with a defense boost, this is great in pvp for Jack Bros team setups. With Mute, defense up it's unlikely your team would fall. Trisagion is a powerful single target skill, it gives him something else to use if your team is walled off by Huang Long.",
    "Teal": "Resist Phys isn't that great. It increases his defense against standard phys attacks but since its not a weakness being covered it doesn't help that much Resist Fire follows the same logic. It's better using stuff like Tarukaja/Rakukaja for damage reduction as they cover all damage, not just a single element"

    "Name": "Huang Di",
    "Description": "The most powerful hero in game with no weaknesses, high strength, high agility, luck, sporting 2 unique skills + Hades Blast. Superior Power (which boosts his accuracy and granting him Phys pierce (!!!) and Yinlong Killer, a sweeping phys skill which adds 50% with high power. With that skillset he's quite devastating in any content and this is probably why (him + Hell Biker/Zaou Gongen setup), you see a lot of anti-phys defense teams in pvp.",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Phys Boost. Damage up, sweeping all day and all night Endure/Enduring Soul for more survival so he can bring the pain. Bloody/Savage Glee. If you want even higher chances for criticals Null Phys (If not Yellow). Prevents reflected damage from killing him Butcher. Pair with Phys Boost (or Amp if you're lucky) to increase his damage even further.",
    "Brands": "War to maximise his damage or Divine if you want to pull off turn 1 Hades Blast + have 2 turn Yinlong Killer spamming. Life can ensure he's bulky. You wouldn't really need Ward as Purple or pulled Teal but it can act as a safety harness. In that case Aim could be nice against evasion teams or Shield for magic defense.",
    "Common": "Life Aid doesn't help that much with him. Due to innate resistances he can take a fair amount of damage, though i suppose this archetype would be better than Yellow's Salvation.",
    "Red": "Berserker God is really good for taking out single targets. If you don't run divine, regardless you can turn one attempt to snipe an enemy. Auto-Taruka Saves you using another demon with it. If you have Ananta, then this skill can be replaced if you wish to",
    "Yellow": "Salvation is not that good on him as he is not a caster (and it's too costly). It's unlikely he'd ever use it in auto. Null Phys is what makes this pulled archetype good (and is the only source of a Null resistance that is transferable). If his attack is repelled he won't die to the reflected damage and so you can sweep teams irregardless of Alilat + repel phys. I'd recommend shifting this to another archetype if you can.",
    "Purple": "Null Charm is amazing for pvp. If he's charmed then chances are he'll take down your own team due to his sheer power. Serial Killer will boost his aoe damage even further but can easily be replaced with Phys boost if you wish (10% vs 15%), or you could run both.",
    "Teal": "Repel Light prevents deaths via God's Bow, light sweeping (e.g. Mastema) and light piercing when paired with Alilat. Infernal mask ensures he's unlikely to be hit by ailments (I wouldn't recommend removing this due to its rarity and how useful it can be)."

    "Name": "Rama",
    "Description": "OP demon with no weaknesses (Immune to fire, resistant to ice). Rama comes with Mabufudyne and 2 unique skills: Drain Pierce (Pierce has no effect on demons with Drain resistances, provided he's alive) and Brahmastra (Almighty hit all 3 times). He's the drain version of Alilat's effect and with Brahmastra, is effective against demons that have avatar/endure/enduring soul.",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Endure/Enduring soul. As long as he's alive you want Brahmastra spam. Butcher/Serial Killer. The only way to boost his almighty damage, though butcher is only obtainable through Skill gacha. Serial killer can be gotten from Shiva. Ice Boost. If you're insistent on using him as an ice piercer, this can be boost up Mabufudyne's damage.",
    "Brands": "Divine. You want to spam spells so this is the only option really, Spell/Life is okay but then you won't be able to 2 turn skills in exchange for more damage/hp.",
    "Common": "He's a magic attacker so Hades Blast has no use to him at all",
    "Red": "Energy Drain is rather lackluster as you'd prefer using Brahmastra instead. Mana Aid makes him really good in pve, essentially you'd wipe out waves with Brahmastra, regain your mana, rinse and repeat. This would make him a really good demon to use in autoing provided he hits hard enough.",
    "Yellow": "Luster Candy would give you another source of a full buff (Though that's better suited to Amaterasu/Huang Long), he won't use it on auto due to being Attack AI. Concentrate would allow you to use him in Jack Bros setups, charging up to deal high amounts of damage.",
    "Purple": "Though you'd want to spam Brahmastra, Ice Pierce would go through 5 elements saving you from bringing Makara Break/Silent Prayer. Ice Age could help for single targeting",
    "Teal": "Drain Ice is an effective counter to other Purple Ramas and can be useful against Makarakarn/5 Elements, Reflect a Mabufudyne off the shield to heal. Null Mute is not that great on him, so it can be replaced."

  {
    "Name": "Siegfried",
    "Description": "An amazing physical attacker with no weaknesses, also draining phys. He utilizes Berserker God, Rebellion and a unique passive 'Arms Mastery' (+15% phys damage/phys hit rate, levellable) making him effective at hitting his target without any problems or repercussions from reflected attacks. Given he naturally has Rebellion, he's also good when paired with Zaou Gongen, granting him phys pierce whenever he uses it.",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Aoe Skill. Since he doesn't come with one, Hades Blast is good. Phys Boost. for more damage Savage/Bloody Glee. For more criticals if you can't be bothered using Rebellion Endure if using Enduring soul to stack it up.",
    "Brands": "War/Life or Divine, he works fine with either. Divine will allow you to turn one Berserker God for pvp.",
    "Common": "Hes good at surviving combat and so Life Aid is useless on him. In pvp it doesn't do anything at all for his kit.",
    "Red": "Maxing out Titanomachia would help in hitting evasive demons such as Garuda and Yatagarasu. Since an aoe is given to you, you then have two free slots to customize whatever you want. Great Aim would add even more accuracy to his attacks, this should enable him to still hit even when the enemy has the evasion advantage with Sukunda/Sukukaja.",
    "Yellow": "Charge is nice but you'd waste a lot of turns setting up both charge and rebellion. Auto-Sukunda is good but again his accuracy is already pretty high. If you want to replace it, Yatagarasu is another source with that auto skill.",
    "Purple": "Enduring Soul adds to his survivability, stack this with Endure to give him an extra two hits until death. Myriad Arrows is nice for bosses, though people prefer to just give him an Aoe instead as he has Berserker God already.",
    "Teal": "Null Force makes him completely immune to Susano-o as it blocks all of his sources of attacks. It can also block Rangda's Mazandyne and since a lot of demons have force in their kits it can shut down a lot of sweeps. Resist Dark can be replaced as it won't really do much on him"

  {
    "Name": "Yoshitsune",
    "Description": "Immune to light and dark, resistant to phys attacks, has high strength, good agility and high luck to boot for criticals. He comes with the unique skill Hassou Tobi (8x random piercing hits), very useful for bosses and brand farming. Innate skills include Vorpal Blade and Mana Aid, making him amazing in Pve, Mana Aid gives him full MP recovery each wave so he can sweep and repeat with Vorpal Blade/Hassou Tobi.",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Phys Boost/Amp. Give him more power. Bloody/Savage Glee. Give him more crit (if not purple) Good/Great Aim. If you find he's missing a lot this can help with accuracy issues. Though you should aim for accuracy % tertiaries from brands. Charge (Optional). To pull off stuff like the Templar Dragon strategy. Luck Amp III. Equivalent to Bloody Glee in terms of crit boosting, but has the added effect of extra crit avoidance, accuracy, evasion, ailment resistance and infliction Butcher. As multi-hit skills count as aoe, this can increase Hassou-Tobi/Vorpal Blade damage. Phys Amp, Boost, Butcher maximises his damage",
    "Brands": "War or Divine. Divine would be better for charge/pvp setups, for pve it isn't really needed",
    "Common": "Enduring Soul would give him more survivability. Pair this up with Endure so he can take 2 extra hits before dying",
    "Red": "Gigantomachia is a direct upgrade to Vorpal Blade, though i feel it is a waste having two aoes on him (Vorpal Blade works anyways). It goes out well with a HB/ZG setup however (due to not needing to worry about criticals) but even so i'd personally recommend the other archetypes over this. God's Hand gives him a powerful single attack skill. Most people replace this as Hassou Tobi can instead be used for bosses.",
    "Yellow": "Charge allows you to ramp up your damage even further; a 5mp charge coupled with Templar Dragon's passive would hit really hard. Auto-Sukuka is a decent auto buff that increases your accuracy and evasion, allowing you to land/dodge hits more often.",
    "Purple": "Phys Amp boosts his damage greatly allow him to hit really hard, ripping them shreds (To shreds you say?) Savage Glee would add onto his crit rate meaning it'll be quite likely in you getting another turn.",
    "Teal": "Drain Phys allows you not to worry about reflected Phys damage and, greatly adding to his survivability (Though if he is charmed, he can hurt himself with Hassou Tobi, healing himself with the rest of his skills). Resist Ice can be replaced as he doesn't have an ice weakness."

  {
    "Name": "Ixtab",
    "Description": "The opposite of a tanky demon as instead of surviving as long as possible she'd prefer to die for me due to her unique passive Yaxche. This activates only on the enemy turn as when she dies: her killer is hit by an almighty attack and is killed with a 100% success rate (same effect as White Rider/Alice). This bypasses Endure/Avatar/Enduring Soul, but doesn't activate if her team is wiped out/she's the last to die. On offense you can easily exploit the game's AI to target her by intentionally leaving her at level 1, or having the least defense/hp/mdef so they're tempted to kill her straight away.",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Resist Light. Not for the purpose of reducing damage, but instead for not giving the enemy extra press turns. Madness. Good when combined with Yellow's Insanity its a good to go with her. Recarmdra, Samarecarm. Bring back allies if she's being targeted last Any other ailment skills like Charm, Mute, Weak, etc. Barrier break to remove barriers for ailment inflicting (though another demon can fulfil this role)",
    "Brands": "Divine, Speed, Spell, Lead combinations all work. Don't give her HP/def/mdef and instead focus on stats like Ailment Infliction, Ailment Resistance, Speed (If you want to act first), Matk % if you want to use her for damage.",
    "Common": "Null Weak prevents a already not that good ailment from hitting her. If you build her up to resist ailments this would help in terms that rely on inflicting Weak.",
    "Red": "Hell Gaze gives her a powerful single target dark skill. Paired with her gacha skill, you can run her as glass cannon. Assassin would boost up the damage of Hell Gaze and her innate Bufudyne as well.",
    "Yellow": "Mahashibaboon sets her up as an ailment user (she naturally has pretty good luck for infliction). Insanity complements this and there's also the fact that levelling up her passive also increases her ailment infliction rate. Give her other ailments and she can pile them on the enemy team.",
    "Purple": "Berserker, usually bad (increase damage dealt, increased damage taken), but in her case has the opposite effect. Auto-Rakunda helps in swinging the offensive balance to your side (pair with Auto-Taruka for the best effect) on match start. You can build for magic as berserker would make her hit harder. She has low strength so don't bother with phys.",
    "Teal": "Null Light covers her weakness which is desired, you wouldn't want the enemy team to get extra press turns off her death (in case they kill her revivers). Mabufudyne gives her an aoe ice skill, its not really needed so up to you whether you keep it or not."

    "Description": "Mot is a tanky caster coming with Megidolaon, Mamudodyne and Harmonius Death, a really useful passive (Every second turn he gains 10% damage (cap = 50%) and an extra press turn). Naturally he repels Force and Dark, meaning if you pair him up with Alilat you can prevent Cu Chulainn + Black Frost sweeps. Given his unique passive, stats and the fact he also resists phys and fire he's a really good defensive demon in pve and pvp content. The longer he's left alive, the more dangerous the enemy team becomes. Note it takes two turns for a 10% jump and so it'd take 10 turns to reach 50%. This is unlikely to be reached in pvp but in pve content such as Kiwami this can prove quite useful depending on who you go up against.",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Resist Elec. The intention is that he'd survive as long as possible to keep Harmonius Death up.",
    "Brands": "Divine would be good due to his costly skills if you want him to two turn them. Life if you don't really care about that and just want his hp to go as high as possible. Stack MAtk % if you want damage, Life% if you want survival.",
    "Common": "Mana Gain gives raises his mp cap to 12. Useless in pvp and not that great in pve",
    "Red": "Deathtouch gives him a single target almighty skill. You can be selective with your attacks but generally Megidolaon and Mamudodyne should be enough. Magic Amp III increases his spell damage further, this can be good for min maxing if you're not sure what else to run.",
    "Yellow": "With Judgement he can enhance his support skills with an aoe that does damage and grants the party tarukaja. Given he's attack AI he can't act as a buff/debuffer to take advantage of skills like Fog/Acid Breath and War Cry so this is one way to make him a buffer at least. Auto-Rakuka is always nice to boost up your starting defence without having to spend a turn casting Rakukaja.",
    "Purple": "With his naturally pretty high life, Life Surge boosts it even higher. Since he wants to be alive for the extra press turn icon you can run Life Brands as well to stack his life up higher and higher. Enduring Soul gives him another life but you should expect him to survive a long time anyways in this archetype.",
    "Teal": "Null Phys prevents a majority of phys demons from doing damage to you (unless they're with HB/ZG). This can be useful for pvp but I'd say moreso for pve. Resist Elec covers his weakness so you save mag fusing Throne."

With these two unique skills he can also be paired with Zaou Gongen to give his attacks a pierce effect. You'd use him to remove barriers first then inflict weak on enemies, once they're weakened they can easily be poisoned which results in him getting Rebellion. An aoe skill is desired of course in order to sweep.",

    "Common": "Strength Amp III would boost his strength for min maxing, nothing that spectacular",
    "Red": "Hades Blast gives him the desired aoe with a cheap 5mp cost too. Savage Glee grants him more criticals, though this isn't needed if you're going for poison.",
    "Yellow": "Toxic Sting naturally complements his passive. Assuming the enemy has no barriers and have been weakened, you can Toxic Sting, inflicting poison then have Rebellion casted on yourself.

    "Purple": "Auto-Taruka is okay on him, but since there are other demons with access to it, its better leaving it to them. Strength Amp III would be good for min-maxing though he'd be better off having his weakness covered + aoe (or phys boost).",

Naturally he comes with War Cry for debuffing and 2 weaknesses himself, meaning by default you get a 6% damage reduction bonus (though this applies only to aoe/multi-target skills). Pairing him with Hecatoncheires would grant you an extra 15% damage reduction and if you don't cover Hecaton's weakness then in total they share 27% damage reduction. So if you do cap out on damage reduction (by bringing demons such as Slime, Abraxas, Arahabaki, etc) this brings it up to a total of 45% essentially halving all damage done. With this strat however, single target skills will still do standard damage to you.",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Resist Fire. For pvp purposes. If you're using him on defence he can easily be nuked by Surt, this can reduce the damage taken by Ragnarok Samarecarm/Recarmdra to bring back allies since your goal is to keep him alive as long as possible",

    "Yellow": "Nocturne is another supporting skill to use to enhance your team's defense and evasion. Coupled with the Tarunda effect from War Cry, once both buffs are up you'll be taking quite miniscule aoe damage. Null Bind is okay and not that great, you can replace it.",
    "Purple": "Tetraka Shift can stop first turn phys, giving you one turn of breathing room, though in higher pvp people generally bring pierce phys demons anyhows. Hell Gaze is pretty bad using the same reasoning as Mamudoon.",

When facing a Hell Biker team, you may be able to survive long enough for all 3 uses of Red Zone wear off, making him immune to their team, as they are oriented towards aoe phys.

He has no weaknesses: Null Phys, Resist Light, Drains Dark (He can't be killed by Alice), the highest strength in the game and really high luck (meaning he can easily crit, have high innate ailment resistance and infliction) and a really powerful base kit. Vorpal Blade for phys aoe, Warlord's Wrath: Granting phys pierce, 100% phys counter and Intimidating Stance all in one passive and Occult Flash: Single target phys damage with 50% crit, 200 power and 100% kill rate. Yup even if you have Tetraja on your demon, odds are they'll die anyways from the heavy damage and crit (even has three uses). Since he's a intimidating stance user, it's best to pair him up with another stance user. I'd recommend Zhong Kui due to his Auto-Taruka having a huge benefit for the both of them. One interesting thing is that counter can be prevented if the unit is bound (credit to itzmeAkA on Reddit). Against Masakado himself, you can then safeguard your phys units through bind (be wary of his high innate ailment resistance though).",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Endure/Enduring Soul. If he's alive and kicking, he'd remain a dangerous foe. Phys Boost/Amp. Increasing his already high damage is always good. Good/Great Aim. Worried about his accuracy? this can help boost it. Null Charm/Hellish/Infernal Mask. A charmed Masakado can be deadly to your team.",
    "Brands": "Divine to two turn Vorpal Blade, Occult Flash. Life can ensure he stays alive and War if you want pure damage/use him for pve only. For secondary, Ward should be gotten unless you run ailment resistance. If that's the case Aim can be good for accuracy, Shield/Guard for defenses.",
    "Common": "Enduring Soul makes him harder to take down, great when stacked with Endure.",

Given he already counters phys hits with a 100% chance, phys units hitting him isn't so scary. Even so this will allow him to heal off repelled damage, so you can intentionally Vorpal Blade into Alilat + Repel Phys unit to heal yourself back up. Auto-Rakuka would add to your team's survability. Paired with double intimidation, you should have no issues surviving being outsped."

    "Name": "Bayonetta ☆",
    "Description": "Bayonetta from the Bayonetta series is a collaboration event character oriented towards criticals and charm. She has no elemental weaknesses, Mortal Jihad for single target phys attacks and two unique abilities (one passive, one active). Madama Stomp (Passive) activates whenever she lands a critical hit, comboing with an almighty attack that has a chance to inflict charm (can be levelled, adding ailment infliction % and critical %), whilst her second ability: Gomorrah (B) is a single target skill and as amazing as it sounds, has a three turn wait and one use, so it's best to save it up for bosses. With quite low hp and vit stats she can fall quite easily, so its kill or be killed unless you pair her up with nice support units that buff/debuff, heal and revive. She can work amazingly with the standard Hell Biker + Zaou Gongen combo as with the guaranteed crit and pierce she can attack, activate her passive and pierce phys at the same time. When it comes to her skills, here are the facts we know: Madama Stomp: Only activates once per action regardless of the skill used. If a multi-hit skill or aoe crits multiple targets then out of the enemies hit by crits, the leftmost target will be hit by Stomp.

Since she'll be able to inflict it, enemies that survive/are charmed will be hit even harder Phys Aoe. For sweeping, if you require pierce then you should run her with Hell Biker + Zaou-Gongen. Zaou by himself if you give her Rebellion as well. Mana Aid. Pve purposes, pair this with a spammable phys aoe and a good crit rate and she can be an excellent farmer.",

She already comes with Mortal Jihad which is better for activating her passive as that would also do extra damage and charm. Deadly Charm works well with her passive and Gomorrah (B), since both inflict charm any subsequent attacks she does to charmed foes will hit way harder.",
    "Purple": "Savage Glee is perfect for boosting her crit rate, leading to more Stomp activations.

    "Name": "Jeanne ☆",
    "Description": "Collaboration event character, Jeanne from the Bayonetta series is built similarly as a mirror to Bayonetta, they both have the same stats and resistances, except St and Ma being flipped meaning Jeanne is naturally more magic focused. Jeanne is Bind oriented and can combo off Bayonetta's charm passive (and any charm source in general). Hades Blast gives her an innate phys aoe (though her strength stat is not that high), Madama Uppercut (passive) allows her to hit charmed foes with an almighty attack (also having a chance to bind them in the process, can be levelled to grant bonus ailment infliction % + evasion %) and Gomorrah (J) enables her to wipe once three turns is up, for sweeping as opposed to Bayonetta's version for boss killing. She is also fairly squishy just like Bayo and instead would pair well with any charm inflicting demon such as Lakshmi, Man Eater and Mother Harlot. When Mother Harlot's passive activates, Jeanne's will too, leading to some bonus damage at the start of the battle (though it's limited to the leftmost demon if multiple are charmed). In pvp a lot of people use ward, Infernal/Hellish Mask and Null Charm so this is moreso for pve such as levelling quests and AG where it's possible to inflict charm on foes. When it comes to her skills, here are the facts we know: Madama Uppercut: Only activates once per action regardless of the skill used. If a multi-hit skill or aoe charms multiple targets then out of the enemies charmed, the leftmost target will be hit by Uppercut. Madama Uppercut: Will be activated by Mother Harlot's Death Lust, Dionysus' Euphoric Frenzy Gomorrah (J): Will tick down whenever it is her turn. If she's dead then it won't tick down.",
    "RecommendedSkills": "Deadly Charm. Activates her passive and so you're guaranteed to get the damage boost off charmed foes Deadly Bondage. Inflicted by her passive, you're highly likely to be able to get the damage boost off this also Endure/Enduring Soul. For pvp purposes. Serial Killer/Butcher. Increases damage done by Hades Blast and Gomorrah (J). You'd want to run her as a aoe unit Megido. I think she'd suit more as a magic unit than phys and so an Almighty aoe attack is always nice.",

    "Yellow": "Dark Sword grants her the ability to mute with phys attacks. Mute doesn't do much for her, let alone phys attacks. Deadly Bondage like Bayonetta's Deadly Charm suits her. Since she can inflict bind really easily, her damage is boosted by this passive at most times.",
    "Purple": "Evade can stack up with her levelled passive to give her a total of 40% base evasion. She can be an amazing evasive mage, dodging attacks from dangerous demons like Huang Di, Masakado in pvp.

He is pretty squishy however and so you should expect him to fall quite easily. This is why you can also find a fair amount of Sleipnir souls in AG 45-50, however this means you don't have to waste Yasaka Magatamas on him as souls should be enough to get your the skill points you need. At minimum he should be level 45 to be most effective for farming.",

For Sloth 10, if you run Divine then once he reaches 0mp from using his other skills he'll start to spam this (so you don't have to worry about phys attacks missing)",

In retrospect he has low HP, Mag, Vit and Agi meaning he can have trouble hitting (luck is factored into hit rate but with low Agi it's balanced out).
